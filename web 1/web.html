    <p>Round of applause to Green Chameleon for winning 
    Site of the Month March with Our 2018: Year in 
    Review, here they share the processes of creating 
    their developer driven 3D time capsule. Thanks for all 
    the votes and tweets, find the winner of the Pro Plan 
    at the end of the article.</p>

<div id="content2">
    <p>Our 2018: Year in Review site was created as a place to document and showcase 
    the year gone by. The agency has evolved, we’ve produced our best work to date 
    and picked up a number of accolades along the way; the Year in Review site was 
    created to give us somewhere to house all of this content in a fun and unique way.</p>

<div id="content3">
    <p>The process for creating the site was a new one for us. The whole concept was 
    driven by dev, meaning our usual way of doing things was flipped; our developer, Ash,
    first showcased the technology and concept of travelling through a 3D space, which 
    we then designed over the top of, adding layers of detail and additional features as 
    we progressed.
    The project was an excuse to make something ‘just for fun’ in a short time frame, but 
    it also taught us a lot; the process of starting in code is something we’ll definitely 
    take forward and incorporate into more projects.</p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>Three.js has some pretty handy frustum culling stuff built in which helped a great 
    deal when it comes to only rendering what is visible, but we needed to extend this 
    functionality to handle when videos should be played and paused as you travel 
    through the timeline. We wanted the user to be able to travel through the timeline as 
    fast as they wanted whilst keeping it as smooth as possible, and constantly playing 
    and pausing videos restricted this. So, we only updated video states when moving at 
    a slow enough speed to keep things as lightweight as possible.</p>

    <h3>Device Video Limits</h3>
    <p>HTML Video element limits wasn’t something we knew about until we stress tested 
    with a few dozen videos. At first we saw a hard limit of 16 videos when testing on an 
    iPad so we tested on a number of other mobile devices and lower spec machines 
    where we came to the conclusion it must be a hardware limitation. We overcame this 
    on these devices by only loading the metadata which includes the video dimensions 
    and the first frame that was required to build the timeline, then clearing the video 
    element and moving onto the next one. The video would then only play once the 
    item had been opened.</p>

    <h5>Technologies</h5>
    <p>Our hosting provider is Digital Ocean, the server is running Nginx on the HTTP2 
    protocol with brotli/gzip compression. This along with optimising assets as much as
    possible means we can serve the site in ~20Mb.
    Aside from HTML and CSS which was used to create the UI around the edge of the 
    screen and the entrance and loading screen, WebGL was at the core of the site – 
    specifically the Three.js library. There were two main challenges that quickly 
    became apparent in the development process: keeping up performance with so 
    many objects in the 3D space, and getting past the device’s limits when it comes to 
    videos.
